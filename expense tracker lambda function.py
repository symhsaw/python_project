"""
Create an expense calculator that have various function
1) Add expense
2) print expenses 
3) print total expenses
4) filter expense by category
5) quit program 

explore the the use lambda function

lambda is same as user-defined function(standalone function)
except that it is anonymous function.

map() applies a function to each item in iterable and returns a lazy iterator
so you need to call it out or force evaluation by consuming the iterator.
e.g force evaluation -> sum() or list()
